# reddit_persona_generator
Reddit Persona Generator is a Python-based tool that scrapes a Reddit user’s posts and comments, and uses a free LLM (like Mistral-7B via OpenRouter.ai) to generate a structured user persona. The persona includes traits such as interests, personality, habits, and demographic guesses — with citations from the user's content.
